# About

This project is a musical keyboard application built using Python's Tkinter library for GUI and Pygame for audio playback. It offers a virtual keyboard interface for users to play musical notes by clicking on buttons corresponding to different keys. The application categorizes keys into white and black, each mapped to a specific sound file. The main window, "Musical Keys," has three sections: one for display of current date, time, and message, one for black keys, and one for white keys. Black keys are labeled with sharp notes, while white keys are labeled with natural notes. The application also displays the current date, time, and customizable message at the top. Users can interact with the keyboard to create melodies or explore different combinations of musical notes.

# Features

The musical keyboard application offers a virtual keyboard interface for users to play musical notes by clicking on buttons corresponding to different keys. The keyboard includes both white and black keys, with each key mapped to a specific sound file. White keys represent natural notes, while black keys represent sharp notes. The main window, "Musical Keys," is divided into three sections: Display, Black Keys, and White Keys. Users can interact with the virtual keyboard to create melodies and explore different combinations of musical notes. This project provides an enjoyable way for users to experiment with music and express their creativity through the virtual keyboard.

# Rating

The application offers basic musical note playing functionality and a clean interface, but there are areas for improvement. It lacks visual feedback for key presses, doesn't support simultaneous key presses, and doesn't support sustained functionality. The GUI design could be improved for aesthetics and user experience. Despite demonstrating basic skills in GUI programming and audio playback, the project could benefit from additional features and refinements to make it more engaging and user-friendly.
